xitools_eboss.py contains all of the python modules (Cosmo.py, healpix.py, optimize.py, baofit_pubtest.py contain required modules)

To setup jack-knifes:
mkran1mil
ranHealp
mkjackf

To make jack-knifed files and job submit files:
createalladfilesfb

Then just do ./suball.sh (things will probably need to be edited to make things work on whatever system you use)

	pp2pt_Dmufb.c does paircounts, compiles on my machine via:
	gcc -Wall -c utila.c
	gcc -Wall -c pp2pt_Dmufb.c
	gcc -Wall -o pp2pt_Dmufb pp2pt_Dmufb.o utila.o

To put pair-counts together and write-out file:
ppxilfile_bs

To look at potential systematic relationships:
ngvsys
(do this first if you want to use any systematic weights)

To make approximate covariance matrices and bao:
docovsandbao

running just python baofit_pubtest.py will do BAO fit for BOSS DR11 data/covariance/model template

other model templates are in BAOtemplates; naming scheme should be explained at some point (and code that generates them should be added at some point)
